microservice_architecture :


Building small e-commerce architecture using microservices. In this project, I have lots of different modules

1. user orders
2. shipping address
3. users details
4. stores those have different products like ( store name: Nike, products: Nike shirts, shoes etc.)
5. API gateway: it will act like a middleware (between the front end and backend ) has various features like routing (Mobile, Web), SSL, Authentication, Authorization, Adaptor, Serve static content, cache, load balancer, protocol adaptor ( switch between protocols like https2 or http1 ) also cavalry release ( will add this in future )


I will also add how we can resolve to cascade failure


### will not add any testing techniques
