I am building small e-commerce architecture using microservices. In this I have different modules

1. user orders
2. shipping addreses
3. users deatils
4. stores those have different products like ( store name : Nike , products : Nike tshirts, shoes etc)
5. api gateway : it will act like a middleware (between front end and backend ) has various features like routing (Mobile, Web), SSL, Authentication, Authrization, Adaptor, Serve static content, cache, load balancer, protocol adaptor ( switch between protocols like https2 or http1 ) also cavary release ( will add this in future )
